## Introduction

**Welcome to my GoLang Codes repository!**
<br><br>
Here, I'm excited to share a collection of GoLang code snippets that I've practiced and refined over time. 
<br>
As I continue to explore and learn, I'll be updating this repository with new code samples and projects. 
<br><br>
Join me on this journey of mastering GoLang, and feel free to contribute your own insights and improvements along the way. 
<br><br>
*Happy coding!*

## How to Run a GoLang Program  ðŸ¤”
1. In the Terminal, Navigate to the Path where the **`.go`** file is located
2. Run the following Command<br>
    ```
    go  run  <FILE-NAME.go>
    ```
## How to Configure External Packages in GoLang Program  ðŸ¤”
1. In the Terminal, Navigate to the **`Folder Path`** where the **`.go`** file is located
2. Run the following Command<br>
    ```
    go  mod  init  <MODULE-NAME>
    ```
3. This command creates a **`go.mod`** file in the project directory, which serves as the module definition file. The **`go.mod`** file tracks the module's dependencies and version information. Once initialized, you can use other go mod commands like **`go mod tidy`** , **`go mod vendor`** , etc., to manage **dependencies** and **versions** within your Go project.

4. Now we can install any external Packages with the following Command
    ```
    go  get  <PACKAGE-NAME>
    ```
